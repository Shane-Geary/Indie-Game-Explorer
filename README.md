# Indie-Game-Explorer
<p>Welcome to the <em>Indie Game Explorer!</em> Here you can explore featured Indie games and browse details and metrics. With the rapid advancement of development technologies, tools, and methodologies of the past decade, solo or small team game developers have been able to achieve remarkable feats in the games they create. However, without large marketing teams and budgets, these games often fail to receive the recognition they deserve. This site aims to showcase some of these underdog titles.</p>
